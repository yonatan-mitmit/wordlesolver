Board reversing

Input - Matches colors, Partial assignment as constraints
Naive approach - try all boards

Constraint space - Hard mode (only valid guesses).
Variant (allow lines with known mistakes) - later


Ofer mode - seed word is known
Take all possible remaining guesses (recursively) and try to add to board until we cannot contine


Technical note - I need to make LM update return a new LM with update constraint while not touching the old one, so I can enjoy the stack here.


Ravi mode - Last word is known, but nothing else.

There's a "dual game" concept here, that is intriguing - given a last word and board, can I "flip" the game". 
Not exactly, but going up each placement is a constraint on preceding words...

Consider the following board Ofer board
slate, crown, dormy, rigor, vigor

Starting with Vigor, we know second word was â¬›ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ© so that gives us that vigor to rigor is â¬›ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

in Ravi Mode - the dual game means that letters that were green in some board and not green in preceeding board are now forbidden...
This needs to "remember" from a letter match"

I need a reverse LetterMatch to solve this
Solution needs to be able to "demote" letters (green->yellow->gray) which is a whole new game





Ofer Sort:
Give each letter a score
n>r>c - high
o>u>i - mid
b>d>g
rest

{
    n : 5
    r : 4.5
    c : 3
    o : 3
    u : 2.5
    i : 2
    rest
}
